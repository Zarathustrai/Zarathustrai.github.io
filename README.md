### BEER MENTOR

NEEDED:
- Adjusting the analysis section (just making the calculations/decision-making process to be displayed) + minor database fixes.
- Fixing the UI design.
- Adding a logo.
- Instructions of running the app in case the website is not fully launched.


DONE:
- Knowledge system
- Point calculation based on answeres.
- Questions.
- Final feedback provided to the user based on the inputs.

EXTRA:
- Hosting the database online to connect it to our website ( zarathustrai.github.io , currently does not have any 'filling' as GitHub only allows static content).
